Description: The American Community Survey (ACS) from the US Census's
    website returns data in a weirdly idiosyncratic way. There are many
    subtotals in each table. Grouping variables are organized in a
    tree-like, rather than tabular fashion. This package is intended to
    make it easy to access and use the ACS data with R.
