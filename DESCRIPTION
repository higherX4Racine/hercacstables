Description: The American Community Survey (ACS) from the US Census's website
    returns data in a weirdly idiosyncratic way. There are many subtotals in
    each table. Grouping variables are organized in a tree-like, rather than
    tabular fashion. This package is intended to make it easy to access and
    use the ACS data with R.
