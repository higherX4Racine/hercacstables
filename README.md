The American Community Survey (ACS) from the US Censusâ€™s website returns
data in a weirdly idiosyncratic way. There are many subtotals in each
table. Grouping variables are organized in a tree-like, rather than
tabular fashion. This package is intended to make it easy to access and
use the ACS data with R.

## Installation

You can install the development version from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("higherX4Racine/hercacstables")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(hercacstables)
## basic example code
```
