The American Community Survey (ACS) from the US Census's website returns data in a weirdly idiosyncratic way. There are many subtotals in each table. Grouping variables are organized in a tree-like, rather than tabular fashion. This package is intended to make it easy to access and use the ACS data with R.

## Installation

You can install the released version of hercacstables from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("hercacstables")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("higherX4Racine/hercacstables")
```
## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:


```r
library(hercacstables)
## basic example code
```
