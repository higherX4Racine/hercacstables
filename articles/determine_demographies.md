# Determine demographies

A **Demographic Group** is a subset of the population that shares
specific traits. Demographic groups can be represented either by groups
(common when reporting by race or ethnicity) or rows (most other cases,
like age, sex, or veteran status). If you were drawing maps, you would
probably have a different version of each map for each demographic
grouping. Examples include the number of Hispanic girls under 5 years
old (table B01001I, row 18), the median income of Asian American
households (table B19013D, row 1), the number of households with no
computer (table B28001, row 11), the number of vehicles used by women
while commuting (table B08015, row 3).
