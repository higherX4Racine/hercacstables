# Determine timeframes

Vintages are years like 2020 or 2005. The vintage of a product like
decennial or ACS data is the year, or most recent year, that it
corresponds to.

Time spans apply to American Community Survey data. Currently, the ACS
reports 1-year data and 5-year data. There was a brief window of time
when they reported 3-year data, but no longer.
