# hercacstables: Work with American Community Survey Tables through the US Census API

The American Community Survey (ACS) from the US Census's website returns
data in a weirdly idiosyncratic way. There are many subtotals in each
table. Grouping variables are organized in a tree-like, rather than
tabular fashion. This package is intended to make it easy to access and
use the ACS data with R.
