A **Demographic Group** is a subset of the population that shares specific
traits.
Demographic groups can be represented either by groups (common when reporting by
race or ethnicity) or rows (most other cases, like age, sex, or veteran status).
If you were drawing maps, you would probably have a different version of each
map for each demographic grouping.
Examples include
the number of Hispanic girls under 5 years old (table B01001I, row 18),
the median income of Asian American households (table B19013D, row 1),
the number of households with no computer (table B28001, row 11),
the number of vehicles used by women while commuting (table B08015, row 3).
