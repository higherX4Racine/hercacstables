A **Geographic Level** is a
[Census-defined hierarchy](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/geography/guidance.html)
from the whole country to small blocks.
The level that you are interested in is determined by the scale of your
question.
If you were drawing maps, these would be the areas that appeared as different
colors.
Examples include congressional districts, incorporated cities, school districts,
and Census tracts.

A **Geographic Area** is a set of specific instances of one or more geographic
levels.
This is the full geographic scope of your question.
If you were drawing maps, this would determine their scale.
Examples include whole states, metropolitan areas, Census-designated places, and
counties.
