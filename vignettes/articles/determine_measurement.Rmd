A **Measurement** is any of the huge number of things that the Census keeps
track of.
Measurements are arranged in tables (called "groups") and rows. 
If you were drawing maps, this would be what determines the color of each area.
Examples include
population size (table B01001 and others),
median household income (table B19013 and others),
types of computers in a household (table B28001),
number of vehicles used while commuting (table B08015).
