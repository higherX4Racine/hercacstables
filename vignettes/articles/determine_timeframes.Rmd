Vintages are years like 2020 or 2005.
The vintage of a product like decennial or ACS data is the year, or most recent
year, that it corresponds to.

Time spans apply to American Community Survey data.
Currently, the ACS reports 1-year data and 5-year data.
There was a brief window of time when they reported 3-year data, but no longer.
